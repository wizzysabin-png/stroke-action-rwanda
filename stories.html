                        <h3>My Stroke Journey: A Story of Survival and Resilience</h3>
                        <p>My name is Alexia Uwajeneza, and I am 46 years old. I have been living with the effects of a stroke for more than 12.5 years.
Before my stroke, I lived a full and stable life. I had a happy family and worked as a midwife. On Sunday, December 19, 2010, at approximately 8:00 a.m., while rushing to attend the first Mass, I suddenly felt extreme weakness and severe dizziness. I lost consciousness shortly afterward.
My husband immediately took me to the nearest private clinic in Muhanga, where I received first aid and briefly regained consciousness. Due to the severity of my condition, I was referred to Kabgayi Hospital. When doctors there were unable to determine the cause of my symptoms, I was referred again to CHUK. Unfortunately, due to overcrowding, I had to wait for an available room. During this time, I stayed with a friend who lived near the hospital.
While waiting, I lost consciousness again and fell into a coma that lasted three days. I was later transferred to King Faisal Hospital, where a CT scan confirmed that I had suffered an ischemic cerebral infarction, resulting in left-sided hemiplegia. I permanently lost the use of my left arm and left leg.
Several months later, I began physiotherapy. However, my recovery has remained very limited due to the large area of the brain that was affected. Over the years, the stroke profoundly altered my life. I lost my job, my property, and many aspects of the life I once knew.
Despite these challenges, my journey did not end there. A few years later, I joined Stroke Action Rwanda, an association supporting people affected by stroke. Becoming part of this community transformed my life. Through peer support and shared experiences, I overcame depression and rediscovered hope. I learned that I was not alone and that my life still had purpose.
Today, as a stroke survivor, I continue to rebuild my strength and resilience. My story is one of survival, courage, and determination. I share it to raise awareness, to support others facing similar challenges, and to affirm that life after stroke—though different—can still be meaningful.

                        <h3>The Strength of Families</h3>
                        <p>Akimanizanye Epiphanie, In March 2020, my husband suffered a stroke, and since then I have served as his primary caregiver. This experience has shown me that stroke is not only a medical emergency but also a long-term social, emotional, and economic challenge that affects entire families.

Before his illness, my husband was fully independent—working, walking, and communicating without difficulty. The sudden loss of these abilities was devastating. Overnight, our family routine, income stability, and emotional wellbeing were profoundly disrupted.

Following hospital discharge, we adhered closely to medical advice, attending regular follow-up appointments and implementing home-based care recommendations. With the support of healthcare professionals and by God’s grace, gradual improvements became visible over time.

During the COVID-19 period, we accessed home-based physiotherapy services for three months. This intervention was critical to recovery but required significant preparation and resources. We had to obtain specialized equipment such as a medical bed, wheelchair, crutches, and install support bars in the home to enable daily rehabilitation exercises. These necessities placed a heavy financial burden on our household.

As caregiving demands increased, our financial resources steadily declined. One of the most painful moments was receiving a formal termination letter from my husband’s employer due to his medical condition. This highlighted how vulnerable stroke survivors and their families are to income loss and social insecurity.

Our challenges were compounded by administrative delays in obtaining medical documentation, which led to the temporary suspension of health insurance coverage by RSSB. During this period, accessing medication and ongoing care became extremely difficult, and we were forced to ration essential treatments.

When pension and insurance issues were eventually resolved, our situation stabilized. In 2022 and 2023, my husband resumed physiotherapy services, requiring twice-weekly travel between Nyamata and Ririma. Managing transportation, care schedules, and household responsibilities became a full-time role.

This experience taught me that caregivers often sacrifice their own wellbeing. Personal health, rest, and professional development are frequently neglected, as attention is focused entirely on the patient’s needs and basic family survival.

I also observed that many stroke survivors and individuals living with long-term illnesses experience emotional distress and may lose hope. Caregivers play a critical role in providing emotional support, encouragement, and spiritual strength. However, caregivers themselves are at high risk of burnout, depression, and stress-related illness. I personally experienced health complications due to prolonged physical and emotional exhaustion, but I recovered after receiving medical care.

My journey as a caregiver underscores the urgent need for stronger community-based support systems, accessible rehabilitation services, caregiver mental health support, and social protection mechanisms for families affected by stroke and other chronic conditions.

Caring for a stroke survivor requires patience, resilience, knowledge, collaboration with healthcare providers, and faith. Most importantly, it requires recognition that caregivers are an essential part of the healthcare system and must be supported accordingly.</p>

                        <h3>Frontline Perspectives</h3>
                        <p>I'm Jean Paul Hakizimana, a senior Physiotherapist with more than 10yrs experience working in clinical services with stroke patients. I would like to share rehabilitation therapy which can help a stroke patient. 

From the day of the stroke and for many months or years afterwards, a person’s movement, sensation, cognition, and emotions can all be affected. The good news is that with the help of a Physiotherapist, the rehabilitation process  Stroke patients can relearn lost skills and develop new skills to regain as much function as possible.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to Physiotherapy for stroke patients, there are some common goals that therapists work towards. These include:

1. Helping the patient regain as much movement and function as possible

2. Reducing pain and discomfort

3. Preventing further problems from developing
Teaching the patient how to manage their condition and live as independently as possible
 

What Does a Physiotherapist Do for a Stroke Patient?

There are many different types of physiotherapy that stroke patients can benefit from, including:

1. Exercise therapy
Exercise plays a big role in physiotherapy for stroke patients. Therapists will design an exercise program tailored to the patient’s individual needs and abilities.

2. Manual therapy
Like exercise therapy, manual therapy is also about helping the patient regain movement and function. 

3. Cognitive rehabilitation
Sometimes, stroke patients can experience problems with their cognition, such as memory loss or difficulties with planning and decision-making. That’s where cognitive rehabilitation comes in. Through this type of therapy, patients can relearn lost skills and develop new ones to help them cope with their cognitive problems

4. Occupational Therapy
Unfortunately, many stroke patients need help with activities of daily living.  Occupational Therapists can help patients regain their independence by teaching them how to perform everyday tasks, such as dressing, cooking, and eating.

5. Speech and language therapy
Often, stroke patients have difficulty speaking clearly. Speech therapy can help by teaching the patient how to speak more clearly and improve their communication skills.

6. Balance training
Balance training is an important part of Physiotherapy for stroke patients. This type of therapy can help the patient regain balance and prevent falls. Some of the exercises used in balance training include walking heel-to-toe, standing on one leg, and walking across a narrow surface.

As you can see, there are many different types of Physiotherapy that stroke patients can benefit from. Each type of therapy is designed to help patients reach their individual goals and improve their quality of life. Sometimes, a combination of different types of therapy is used to achieve the best results.

Great courage, high determination and perseverance can help to recover and achieve many goals in life after stroke.</p>
