Helping the patient regain as much movement and function as possible 2. Reducing pain and discomfort 3. Preventing further problems from developing Teaching the patient how to manage their condition and live as independently as possible What Does a Physiotherapist Do for a Stroke Patient? There are many different types of physiotherapy that stroke patients can benefit from, including: 1. Exercise therapy Exercise plays a big role in physiotherapy for stroke patients. Therapists will design an exercise program tailored to the patient’s individual needs and abilities. 2. Manual therapy Like exercise therapy, manual therapy is also about helping the patient regain movement and function. 3.

That’s where cognitive rehabilitation comes in. Through this type of therapy, patients can relearn lost skills and develop new ones to help them cope with their cognitive problems 4.

Occupational Therapists can help patients regain their independence by teaching them how to perform everyday tasks, such as dressing, cooking, and eating. </p>

        <p>5. Speech and language therapy Often, stroke patients have difficulty speaking clearly. Speech therapy can help by teaching the patient how to speak more clearly and improve their communication skills. 6. Balance training Balance training is an important part of Physiotherapy for stroke patients. This type of therapy can help the patient regain balance and prevent falls. Some of the exercises used in balance training include walking heel-to-toe, standing on one leg, and walking across a narrow surface. As you can see, there are many different types of Physiotherapy that stroke patients can benefit from. Each type of therapy is designed to help patients reach their individual goals and improve their quality of life. Sometimes, a combination of different types of therapy is used to achieve the best results. Great courage, high determination and perseverance can help to recover and achieve many goals in life after stroke.</p>
